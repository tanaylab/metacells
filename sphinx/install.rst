Installation
============

In short: ``pip install metacells``. If you do not have ``sudo`` privileges, you might need to ``pip
install --user metacells``. Note that ``metacells`` requires many "heavy" dependencies, most notably
``numpy``, ``pandas``, ``scipy``, ``scanpy``, which ``pip`` should automatically install for you.

Note that ``metacells`` only runs natively on Linux and MacOS. To run it on a Windows computer, you
must activate `Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl>`_ and
install ``metacells`` within it.

The metacells package contains extensions written in C++. The ``metacells`` distribution provides
pre-compiled Python wheels for both Linux and MacOS, so installing it using ``pip`` should not
require a C++ compilation step.

Note that for X86 CPUs, these pre-compiled wheels were built to use AVX2 (Haswell/Excavator CPUs or
newer), and will not work on older CPUs which are limited to SSE. Also, these wheels will not make
use of any newer instructions (such as AVX512), even if available. While these wheels may not the
perfect match for the machine you are running on, they are expected to work well for most machines.

To see the native capabilities of your machine, you can ``grep flags /proc/cpuinfo | head -1`` which
will give you a long list of supported CPU features in an arbitrary order, which may include
``sse``, ``avx2``, ``avx512``, etc. You can therefore simply ``grep avx2 /proc/cpuinfo | head -1``
to test whether AVX2 is/not supported by your machine.

You can avoid installing the pre-compiled wheel by running ``pip install metacells
--install-option='--native'``. This will force ``pip`` to compile the C++ extensions locally on your
machine, optimizing for its native capabilities, whatever these may be. This will take much longer
but may give you faster results (note: the results will **not** be exactly the same as when running
the precompiled wheel due to differences in floating-point rounding). Also, this requires you to
have a C++ compiler which supports C++14 installed (either ``g++`` or ``clang``). Installing a C++
compiler depends on your specific system; if you are using ``conda``, ``CONDA_BUILD=1 conda activate
mc2`` should work.
