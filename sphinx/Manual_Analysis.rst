Metacells Manual Analysis Vignette
==================================

This vignette demonstrates a possible manual analysis of the metacells
generated from the basic `metacells
vignette <Metacells_Vignette.html>`__. The
`metacells_vignette.tgz <http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~atanay/metac_data/metacells_vignette.tgz>`__
file contains the basic metacells vignette jupyter notebook as well
as this one.

Preparation
-----------

You should first run the basic metacells vignette to obtain the file
``metacells.h5ad``. Next, we will require the R libraries we will be
using:

.. code:: r

    require('anndata')
    require('chameleon')
    require('pheatmap')
    require('pracma')
    require('stats')



.. code::

    Loading required package: anndata

    Warning message:
    “package ‘anndata’ was built under R version 4.1.0”
    Loading required package: chameleon

    Warning message:
    “package ‘chameleon’ was built under R version 4.1.0”
    Loading required package: pheatmap

    Warning message:
    “package ‘pheatmap’ was built under R version 4.1.0”
    Loading required package: pracma

    Warning message:
    “package ‘pracma’ was built under R version 4.1.0”


Getting the raw data
--------------------

We will use the data generated by the metacells vignette, the
``metacells.h5ad`` file generated by it. We’ll also read the list of
forbidden genes for use below.

.. code:: r

    mdata <- anndata::read_h5ad('metacells.h5ad')

Metacells Marker Genes
----------------------

A possible starting point for anlayzing the data is looking at the genes
that are different in each metacell vs. the rest of the population. Such
marker genes are good candidates for investigating the captured cell
behaviors. We’ll start by converting the raw UMIs counts to a log scale
for more convenient analysis:

.. code:: r

    umis <- as.matrix(mdata$X)
    fractions <- umis / rowSums(umis)
    log_fractions <- log2(1e-5 + fractions)

We can use this matrix to, for each metacell, look for a few genes that
are most entriched in it compated to the overall population:

.. code:: r

    genes_per_metacell <- 2
    minimal_max_log_fraction_of_interesting_genes <- -10
    minimal_relative_log_fraction_of_candidate_genes <- 2

    median_log_fractions_of_genes <- apply(log_fractions, 2, median)
    relative_log_fractions <- sweep(log_fractions, 2, median_log_fractions_of_genes)
    max_log_fractions_of_genes <- apply(log_fractions, 2, max)

    interesting_genes_mask <- (max_log_fractions_of_genes
                            >= minimal_max_log_fraction_of_interesting_genes)
    marker_genes <- unique(
        unlist(
            apply(
                relative_log_fractions[,interesting_genes_mask],
                1,
                function(relative_log_fraction_of_metacell) {
                    candidate_genes_mask <- (relative_log_fraction_of_metacell
                                          >= minimal_relative_log_fraction_of_candidate_genes)
                    names(
                        head(
                            sort(-relative_log_fraction_of_metacell[candidate_genes_mask]),
                            n=genes_per_metacell
                        )
                    )
                }
            )
        )
    )
    print(length(marker_genes))


.. code::

    [1] 72


This gave us 84 genes to look at (you can get more or less genes
modifying the parameters, especially ``genes_per_metacell``). We can
visualize the structure of the data using these genes, which could be a
first step towards understaning the different cell behaviors:

.. code:: r

    breaks <- pracma::interp1(0:7, c(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), 0:140/20)
    colors <- colorRampPalette(c('darkred', 'red', 'white', 'white', 'lightblue', 'blue', 'darkblue'))(141)
    options(repr.plot.width = 23, repr.plot.height = 13)
    pheatmap::pheatmap(
        t(relative_log_fractions[,marker_genes]),
        treeheight_col=0,
        treeheight_row=0,
        cellwidth=1,
        cellheight=10,
        show_rownames=TRUE,
        show_colnames=FALSE,
        main='Metacell Marker Genes',
        color=colors,
        breaks=breaks,
        legend=TRUE
    )

Clustering
----------

The 1st step we’ll do is to cluster the metacells. Ideally, we’d have
“similar” cell types in the same cluster and “different” cell behaviors
in different clusters. The specific algorithm doesn’t matter (much) as
these clusters would only be used in guiding us towards understanding
the true structure of the data. The key requirement is that the method
will create clusters which are “homogeneous”, even if at the cost of
creating (a few) different clusters for “very similar” behaviors.

In this example, we perform K-means analysis of the data (looking only
at “interesting” genes), choosing a large enough K. If we choose a
too-low K (see a cluster which is contains “too-different” behaviors)
we’ll need to backtrack and repeat the analysis with a higher K. If we
choose a too-high K we’ll get multiple clusters that are “too-similar”,
which is easy to recover from by assigning the same annotation to
metacells in both clusters. However, we want K to be reasonably smaller
than the number of metacells to help us detect internal structure. We
have chosen K=32 for this example.

We also need to decide on how to compute distances between metacells for
the clustering. Here we chose to only look at the top feature genes (as
selected for the UMAP projection the basic metacells vignette), and use
the log of each such feature gene expression (fraction in each cell).
Again, other methods are also possible, as long as we generate
reasonable quality clusters.

.. code:: r

    umis <- as.matrix(mdata$X)
    fractions <- umis / rowSums(umis)
    log_fractions <- log2(1e-5 + fractions)
    feature_log_fractions <- log_fractions[,mdata$var$top_feature_gene]
    dim(feature_log_fractions)



.. raw:: html

    <style>
    .list-inline {list-style: none; margin:0; padding: 0}
    .list-inline>li {display: inline-block}
    .list-inline>li:not(:last-child)::after {content: "\00b7"; padding: 0 .5ex}
    </style>
    <ol class=list-inline><li>1546</li><li>724</li></ol>



This has given us a matrix of 1542 metacells and 622 genes expression
levels in each one. We can now use this to cluster the metacells into
coarse groups:

.. code:: r

    set.seed(123456)
    k_means <- stats::kmeans(feature_log_fractions, centers=32)
    cluster_of_metacells <- as.integer(k_means$cluster)
    mdata$obs$cluster <- cluster_of_metacells

We now split our 1542 metacells to 32 clusters, which is much more
manageable. Before we actually start analyzing the structure of the
metacells using this clusters, let us give each one a unique color. We
can use the ``chameleon`` package to automatically assign colors to the
clusters in a way that hopefully somewhat reflects the clusters
structure, using the same interesting genes.

.. code:: r

    color_of_clusters <- chameleon::data_colors(feature_log_fractions, group=mdata$obs$cluster)

For example, we can use these colors to display the 2D UMAP projection
computed by the basic metacells vignette:

.. code:: r

    color_of_metacells <- color_of_clusters[cluster_of_metacells]
    plot(mdata$obs$umap_x, mdata$obs$umap_y, col=color_of_metacells, pch=19, cex=3)



.. image:: output_18_0.png
   :width: 1380px
   :height: 780px


This shows us a pretty nice locality of the clusters in the 2D UMAP
projection, which makes them a good start for the manual analysis. It
does not, however, mean that we have exactly 32 distinct behaviors in
the data (from actual manual analysis of the data, the number of more
like 23). That is, and as is suggested by the projection, in some cases
a few clusters cover what we may consider to be a single behavior
(possibly artificially quantizing a smooth gradient into distinct
steps).

Gene-Gene Analysis
------------------

An effective analysis tool is a gene-gene scatter plot where each point
is a metacell, typically colored using some per-metacell annotations
(here we’ll use the above clusters). These gene-gene scatter plots allow
visualizing distinct and gradients of cell behaviors. For example, the
following will visualize the gradient of T-cells from naive to
effectors, using the GNLY and GZMK gene expression levels:

.. code:: r

    GNLY <- log_fractions[,'GNLY']
    GZMK <- log_fractions[,'GZMK']
    plot(GNLY, GZMK, col=color_of_metacells, pch=19, cex=4)

Full Analysis and MCView
------------------------

A full analysis requires using multiple gene-gene plots to identify
marker genes and using them to annotate the metacells with meaningful
type labels. Such analysis is labor intensive and is best done using a
supporting tool. Sometimes during such analysis one discovers a lateral
gene module which threw off the original metacell computation; this
requires adding the relevant genes to the forbidden genes list (or in
extreme cases, the excluded genes list), and recomputing the metacells,
which then requires re-annotating the new metacells. Here again a
supporting tool can help in minimizing the effort of annotating the new
metacells using the insights gained from analysing the original
metacells.

An example of such a manual tool is
`MCView <https://tanaylab.github.io/MCView>`__, which provides a
convenient GUI for performing such a fuller annalysis. It is convenient
to provide this tool with the clusters we computed above to use as a
starting point for the analysis. We’ll therefore export the clusters
data by re-writing the ``metacells.h5ad`` file to include the
per-metacell cluster annotations, and also write a CSV file specifying
the cluster colors; these two files can then be imported into MCView for
further analysis.

.. code:: r

    mdata$write_h5ad('metacells.h5ad')
    write.csv(list(cluster=1:length(color_of_clusters), color=color_of_clusters),
              row.names=FALSE, file='cluster-colors.csv')



.. code::

    None
