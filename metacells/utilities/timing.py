"""
Timing
------

The first step in achieving reasonable performance is identifying where most of the time is being
spent. The functions in this module allow to easily collect timing information about the relevant
functions or steps within functions in a controlled way, with low overhead, as opposed to collecting
information about all functions which has higher overheads and produces mountains of mostly
irrelevant data.
