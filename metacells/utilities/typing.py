Typing
------

The code has to deal with many different alternative data types for what is essentially two basic
data types: 2D matrices and 1D vectors.

Specifically, we have pandas data frames and series, Scipy sparse matrices, and numpy
multi-dimensional arrays (not to mention the deprecated numpy matrix type).

Python has the great ability to "duck type", so in an ideal world, we could just pretend these are
just two data types and be done. In practice, this is hopelessly broken.

First, even operations that exists for all data types sometimes have different interfaces
(as in, ``np.foo(matrix, ...)`` vs. ``matrix.foo(...)``).

Second, operating on sparse and dense data often requires completely different code paths.

This makes it very easy to write code that works today and breaks tomorrow when someone passes a
pandas series to a function that expects a numpy array and it just *almost* works correctly (and god
help the poor soul that mixes up a numpy matrix with a numpy 2d array, or passes a categorical
pandas series to something that expects a series of strings).

"Eternal vigilance is the cost of freedom" - the solution here is to define a bunch of fake types,
which are almost entirely for the benefit of the ``mypy`` type checker (with some run-time
assertions as well).

This not only makes the code intent explicit ("explicit is better than implicit") but also allows us
to leverage ``mypy`` to catch errors such as applying a numpy operation on a sparse matrix, etc.

To put some order in this chaos, the following concepts are used:

* :py:const:`Shaped` is any 1d or 2d data in any format we can work with. :py:const:`Matrix` is
  any 2d data, and :py:const:`Vector` is any 1d data.

* For 2D data, we allow multiple data types that we can't directly operate on:
  most :py:class:`SparseMatrix` layouts, :py:class:`PandasFrame` and ``np.matrix`` have
  strange quirks when it comes to directly operating on them and should be avoided, while CSR and
  CSC :py:class:`CompressedMatrix` sparse matrices and properly-laid-out 2D numpy arrays
  :py:const:`NumpyMatrix` are in general well-behaved. We therefore introduce the concept of
  :py:const:`ProperMatrix` vs. :py:const:`ImproperMatrix` types, and provide functions that
  manipulate whether the "proper" data is in row-major or column-major order.

* For 1D data, we just distinguish between :py:class:`PandasSeries` and 1D numpy
  :py:const:`NumpyVector` arrays, as these are the only types we allow. In theory we could have also
  allowed for sparse vectors but mercifully these are very uncommon so we can just ignore them.

Ironically, now that ``numpy`` added type annotations, the usefulness of the type hints added here
has decreased, since both :py:const:`NumpyVector` and :py:const:`NumpyMatrix` are aliases to the
same ``numpy.ndaarray`` type. Perhaps in the future numpy would allow for using ``Annotated`` types
(with explicit number of dimensions, or even - gasp - the element data type) to allow for more
useful type annotations. Or this could all be ported to Julia and avoid this whole mess.
