    Find genes which have high ``feature_gene`` value.

    This is applied after computing metacells to pick the "strongest" feature genes. If using the
    direct algorithm (:py:func:`metacells.pipeline.direct.compute_direct_metacells`) then all
    feature genes are equally "strong"; however, if using the divide-and-conquer algorithm
    (:py:func:`metacells.pipeline.divide_and_conquer.divide_and_conquer_pipeline`,
    :py:func:`metacells.pipeline.divide_and_conquer.compute_divide_and_conquer_metacells`) then this
    will pick the genes which were most commonly used as features across all the piles.

    **Input**

    Annotated ``adata``, where the observations are cells and the variables are genes, where
    ``feature_gene`` is a per-variable (gene) annotation counting how many times each gene was used
    as a feature.

    **Returns**

    Variable (Gene) Annotations
        ``top_feature_gene``
            A boolean mask indicating whether each gene was found to be a top feature gene.

    If ``inplace`` (default: {inplace}), this is written to the data, and the function returns
    ``None``. Otherwise this is returned as a pandas series (indexed by the variable names).

    **Computation Parameters**

    1. Restrict the search just to genes included in the ``significant_gene`` mask, if it exists.

    2. Look for the lowest positive ``feature_gene`` threshold such that at most ``max_genes`` are
       picked as top feature genes. Note we may still pick more than ``max_genes``, for example when
       using the direct algorithm, we always return all feature genes as there's no way to
       distinguish between them using the ``feature_gene`` data.
