    "\n",
    "The 1st step we'll do is to cluster the metacells. Ideally, we'd have \"similar\" cell types in the same cluster and \"different\" cell behaviors in different clusters. The specific algorithm doesn't matter (much) as these clusters would only be used in guiding us towards understanding the true structure of the data. The key requirement is that the method will create clusters which are \"homogeneous\", even if at the cost of creating (a few) different clusters for \"very similar\" behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we  perform K-means analysis of the data (looking only at \"interesting\" genes), choosing a large enough K. If we choose a too-low K (see a cluster which is contains \"too-different\" behaviors) we'll need to backtrack and repeat the analysis with a higher K. If we choose a too-high K we'll get multiple clusters that are \"too-similar\", which is easy to recover from by assigning the same annotation to metacells in both clusters. However, we want K to be reasonably smaller than the number of metacells to help us detect internal structure. We have chosen K=32 for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to decide on how to compute distances between metacells for the clustering. Here we chose to only look at the top feature genes (as selected for the UMAP projection the basic metacells vignette), and use the log of each such feature gene expression (fraction in each cell). Again, other methods are also possible, as long as we generate reasonable quality clusters."

Such analysis is labor intensive and is best done using a supporting tool. Sometimes during such analysis one discovers a lateral gene module which threw off the original metacell computation; this requires adding the relevant genes to the lateral genes list (or in extreme cases, the excluded genes list), and recomputing the metacells, which then requires re-annotating the new metacells. Here again a supporting tool can help in minimizing the effort of annotating the new metacells using the insights gained from analysing the original metacells.\n",

We'll therefore export the clusters data by re-writing the `metacells.h5ad` file to include the per-metacell cluster annotations, and also write a CSV file specifying the cluster colors; these two files can then be imported into MCView for further analysis."
