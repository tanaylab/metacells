The metacells package implements the improved metacell algorithm [1]_ for single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) data analysis within the `scipy https://www.scipy.org/` framework. The original metacell
algorithm [2]_ was implemented in R. The python package contains various algorithmic improvements
and is scalable for larger data sets (millions of cells).
